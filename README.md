# Smart-Diet

Smart Diet is an AI-powered HealthTech platform that creates personalized diet plans tailored not only to fitness goals but also to specific health conditions. Many people struggle with deciding what to eat when they are managing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or obesity — or when they simply want to lose or gain weight in a healthy way. Smart Diet provides an intelligent solution by generating meal plans that align with both medical needs and lifestyle goals.

When users enter their details such as age, weight, activity level, health condition, and target (weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance), Smart Diet generates personalized meal suggestions. For example, a user with diabetes will be shown low-glycemic food options, while someone aiming for muscle gain will receive protein-rich recommendations. This ensures that every plan is medically relevant, safe, and goal-oriented.

The platform also features a Progress Tracker, where users can monitor calorie intake, workouts, and weight changes. With visual feedback and streaks, Smart Diet keeps users accountable and motivated throughout their journey. In addition, a Community Sharing feature enables users to share their experiences and learn from others, creating a supportive environment that encourages long-term commitment.

Looking ahead, Smart Diet aims to expand with features like a barcode-based food scanner for instant nutrition logging, integration with wearables such as Fitbit and Google Fit for real-time health monitoring, and community challenges to drive user engagement.

In short, Smart Diet is more than just a diet planner — it’s a personalized health and nutrition coach. By focusing on both lifestyle goals and chronic health conditions, it empowers users to eat smarter, live healthier, and stay in control of their well-being.
